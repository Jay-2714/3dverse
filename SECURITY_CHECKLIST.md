# Security Checklist ✅

## Environment Variables Security

### ✅ Completed Items
- [x] `.env` file is excluded from Git via `.gitignore`
- [x] Created `.env.example` with placeholder values
- [x] No hardcoded API URLs in frontend code
- [x] No hardcoded OAuth credentials in source code
- [x] All sensitive configuration uses `process.env` variables
- [x] Backend test script uses environment variables
- [x] API base URLs are configurable via environment variables
- [x] Admin credentials are configurable via environment variables

### ✅ Security Measures in Place
1. **Frontend API URLs**: Using `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` with safe fallback
2. **OAuth Credentials**: All stored in `.env` file only
3. **Database URLs**: Configurable via environment variables
4. **JWT Secrets**: Stored in `.env` file only
5. **Admin Configuration**: Using `ADMIN` environment variable

### ✅ Files Updated
- `src/app/(auth)/login/page.tsx` - Now uses env variable for API URL
- `src/app/(auth)/register/page.tsx` - Now uses env variable for API URL  
- `backend/test_auth.sh` - Now uses env variable for backend URL
- `.env.example` - Created with placeholder values
- `ENV_SETUP.md` - Documentation for environment setup

### ✅ Git Safety
- `.env` file has never been committed to repository
- `.gitignore` properly excludes `.env` and `.env*.local` files
- Only `.env.example` with placeholders will be committed

## Recommendations for Deployment

1. **Production Environment Variables**:
   - Generate new secure secrets for production
   - Use production URLs for all services
   - Enable HTTPS for all endpoints

2. **CI/CD Pipeline**:
   - Set environment variables in deployment platform
   - Never store secrets in CI/CD configuration files
   - Use secret management services when available

3. **Monitoring**:
   - Monitor for any accidental credential exposure
   - Rotate secrets regularly
   - Use different credentials for different environments

## Status: ✅ SECURE
No private URLs or credentials are exposed in the codebase. All sensitive information is properly managed through environment variables.
